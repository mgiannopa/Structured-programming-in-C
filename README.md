This project is a sailing game written in C for the Structured Programming course in the 1st semester of ECE AUTH. The project was developed in collaboration with [Christos Ioakeimidis](https://github.com/cioakeim), where you must navigate your ship around an island without colliding with it or any of the opponent ships. In this effort, you must also account for the constantly changing wind (both in direction and strength), which can prove to be fatal.
